#### The ultimate toolkit to debug League of Legends

## FinalesFunkeln
This tool allows you to read and see all of the RTMP packets being sent by the client or the server

Extermly useful tool; however, the src has not been updated. The compiled beta has fixed some of the bugs with the first versions and does not crash as often.
