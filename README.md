# RitoPls
#### The ultimate toolkit to debug League of Legends (client, not gameclient)

## FinalesFunkeln
This tool allows you to read and see all of the RTMP packets being sent by the client or the server

Extermly useful tool; however, the src has not been updated. The compiled beta has fixed some of the bugs with the first versions and does not crash as often.

Compiled Beta: https://github.com/eddy5641/RitoPls/releases/tag/ToolKit

## Proxifier and Burp
These tools allows you to proxy the League of Legends connection and read the HTTPS connection requests (Beautiful MITM Attack)

Proxifier can force League of Legends to connect to Burp proxy
